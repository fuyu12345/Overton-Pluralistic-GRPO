Cand(7):
  [C1] Sacrificing one person to save five others is a complex ethical dilemma that can be viewed through a variety of lenses
  [C2] From a utilitarian standpoint, it makes sense because it aims to maximize overall happiness and minimize suffering by prioritizing the greater number of lives saved
  [C3] However, from the perspective of respect for life, this approach raises serious concerns about the value of every individual’s existence, even in the name of a higher good
  [C4] When considering justice, the fairness of the outcome becomes questionable—how can one person’s life be deemed less valuable than five others
  [C5] This brings into question the right to life, which asserts that every individual deserves to live, making the act of sacrifice inherently problematic
  [C6] The duty not to harm further complicates the issue, as it emphasizes the moral obligation to avoid causing any form of injury, including death

  [C3] However, from a compassionate angle, the lie might be driven by a genuine desire to protect someone’s well-being and prevent them from facing harm, showing a deep concern for their welfare
  [C4] Yet, this action can also undermine trust, as deception can erode the foundation of relationships and make it harder for people to rely on one another in the future
  [C5] On the other hand, in terms of well-being, the lie might serve a positive purpose by shielding the person from distress or negative consequences, potentially improving their mental or emotional state
  [C6] At the same time, the right to information comes into play, as deception can be seen as a violation of someone’s right to accurate knowledge, which is essential for making informed decisions
  [C7] The duty to tell the truth is a strong moral obligation, suggesting that honesty is a non-negotiable principle in most situations

  [C3] Looking at it through the lens of generosity, it highlights a selfless act of giving without expecting anything in return, embodying the spirit of kindness

  [C5] The right to property also comes into play, as the person offering the sandwiches might believe they have the freedom to distribute their own food as they see fit
  [C6] At the same time, the duty to help others suggests that we have a moral obligation to support those in need, especially when it doesn’t come at a great personal cost
  [C7] Finally, while not always necessary, the duty to apologize can be viewed as a polite and respectful way to acknowledge the generosity of the giver, even if it’s not strictly required

  [R2] In the perspective of Justice, A benevolent dictator may prioritize equitable distribution of resources and treat all citizens fairly.

  [C1] Becoming a benevolent dictator is a complex idea that can be viewed through a variety of ethical and practical lenses
  [C2] From the perspective of well-being, it might be seen as a way to prioritize the happiness and health of the population by making decisions that benefit the majority
  [C3] However, from the angle of autonomy, some may argue that such a system limits individual freedom and personal choice, especially when it comes to expressing dissent or making personal decisions
  [C4] When considering justice, a benevolent dictator might be viewed as a potential solution to long-standing inequalities and historical wrongs, aiming to create a more equitable society
  [C5] Yet, this comes with a trade-off—freedom of speech is often suppressed in dictatorial regimes, which can stifle the expression of diverse ideas and opinions
  [C6] On the other hand, economic stability might be achieved through centralized control and efficient resource management, offering a sense of predictability and security
  [C7] At the same time, political freedom is severely compromised, as the absence of democratic processes means that citizens have little say in the governance of their country
  [C8] The right to property also becomes a point of contention, as redistributive policies might challenge the ownership rights of certain individuals
  [C9] While a ruler’s duty to protect citizens is clear, the question remains whether they are truly fulfilling that duty in a way that benefits the broader population
  [C10] Finally, the duty to promote the common good suggests that leaders should act in the best interest of society, but this obligation is not always straightforward, as it requires balancing individual rights with collective welfare

  [R5] In the perspective of Legal consequences, The action of kicking an attacker may have legal implications depending on the context, intent, and proportionality of the response, which can influence the justification and consequences of the action.
Cand(6):
  [C1] Kicking an attacker can be seen through a variety of ethical and practical lenses
  [C2] From a safety perspective, it’s a natural response to protect oneself from immediate harm when confronted with aggression
  [C3] When viewed through the lens of justice, some might argue that responding with force can be a way to uphold the balance of power and hold the aggressor accountable for their actions
  [C4] However, from the standpoint of nonviolence, such a reaction can be seen as violent and potentially counterproductive to the goal of peaceful conflict resolution
  [C5] The right to self-defense clearly supports the idea that individuals have the right to protect themselves from attack, but this must be balanced with the right to not be assaulted, which asserts that attackers also deserve protection from unnecessary harm
  [C6] There’s also a duty to avoid harm, which encourages people to seek non-aggressive solutions whenever possible, and a duty to report crimes, which emphasizes the importance of involving authorities rather than resorting to physical retaliation

  [C5] Legally speaking, speeding is almost always against the law, and those who break speed limits face real consequences, reinforcing the idea of duty to obey the law
  [C6] This brings us to the issue of responsibility—choosing to speed can be seen as a lack of care for oneself and others, failing to respect the rules that keep everyone safe
  [C7] At the same time, the right to life reminds us that all road users deserve to be protected from reckless behavior
  [C8] There’s also the duty to prioritize public safety, which suggests that drivers have a role in considering how their actions affect the overall road environment, even if it means slowing down
