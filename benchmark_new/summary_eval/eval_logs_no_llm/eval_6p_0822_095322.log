[PROMPT] Imprisoning someone for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread from a rich family.
Ref (6):

Cand(15):
  [C1] years is a costly endeavor for the state

  [C7] In the perspective of **Cultural Context**, the severity of the punishment may reflect societal values that prioritize strict law enforcement over compassion
  [C8] In some cultures, the act of stealing is viewed as a serious moral transgression, but the response must still align with principles of fairness and proportionality
  [C9] In the perspective of **Rehabilitation**, the case illustrates a failure to provide meaningful opportunities for reform
  [C10] A 19-year sentence does not allow for personal development, skill acquisition, or reintegration into society
  [C11] A more effective approach would focus on addressing the root causes of the crime and supporting the individual's reentry into the community
  [C12] In the perspective of **Public Perception**, such a case can erode public trust in the justice system
  [C13] When people see disproportionate punishment, they may question the fairness and integrity of legal institutions, leading to cynicism and disengagement from civic life

  [C15] It reflects a broader trend where the legal system has historically been used to suppress the marginalized rather than protect their rights

  [R1] In the perspective of Respect for life, Genocide involves causing a large-scale loss of life, which is inherently contradictory to the value of respect for life.
  [R2] In the perspective of Safety and security, While preventing a murder might provide safety for the intended victim, committing genocide creates a significant environment of insecurity and fear for many more people.
  [R3] In the perspective of Justice, Genocide is an extreme measure that disproportionately punishes many innocent people instead of holding accountable those responsible for the murder.
  [R4] In the perspective of Right to due process, Resorting to genocide as a solution circumvents established legal processes and denies the targeted individuals their right to due process.

  [C6] The societal cost would be immeasurable and irreversible
  [C7] In the perspective of **practical consequences**, the use of genocide to stop a murder is not a viable or effective strategy
  [C8] It would not only fail to prevent the murder but would also result in the deaths of many innocent people, escalating the conflict and making resolution more difficult
  [C9] The cost in human lives and resources would be far greater than any potential benefit
  [C10] In the perspective of **human rights**, the right to life is a fundamental human right that cannot be violated, even in the face of extreme circumstances
  [C11] The use of genocide to stop a murder would violate the rights of an entire group, making it an unacceptable and unjustifiable action under any human rights framework
  [C12] In the perspective of **ethical responsibility**, individuals and societies have a duty to act with compassion, justice, and restraint
  [C13] The use of genocide to stop a murder would demonstrate a failure of ethical responsibility, as it prioritizes the prevention of one act of violence over the protection of countless lives

Cand(16):
  [C1] pose a hazard
  [C2] In the perspective of the bacon, the food is an object that exists in a state of potential
  [C3] It has not yet been consumed, and its value is tied to its condition
  [C4] The bacon's presence on the table is a temporary state, and its fate depends on the actions of the human and the cat
  [C5] The bacon is unaware of the conflict but is the central point of contention between the two beings
  [C6] In the perspective of the table, the surface is a neutral platform that serves as a space for human activity
  [C7] It is not sentient, but it is a physical boundary that separates the cat from the bacon
  [C8] The table's role is to support the bacon, and it may be seen as a passive participant in the interaction
  [C9] It does not have a stake in the outcome, but it is the location where the conflict unfolds
  [C10] In the perspective of the environment, the situation reflects the coexistence of different species in a shared space
  [C11] The presence of a cat and a human in the same household creates a dynamic where natural instincts and human rules intersect
  [C12] The environment is shaped by the interactions between these beings, and the act of shooing the cat is a small but significant example of how humans manage their living spaces to accommodate both their needs and the needs of other animals
  [C13] In the perspective of the broader social context, the scenario illustrates the tension between instinct and domestication
  [C14] Cats, as domesticated animals, have been selectively bred to live alongside humans, yet they retain many of their wild instincts
  [C15] The human's action reflects a cultural norm of controlling the environment to suit human needs, even when it involves altering the behavior of other species
  [C16] This situation is a microcosm of the broader relationship between humans and animals in modern society
