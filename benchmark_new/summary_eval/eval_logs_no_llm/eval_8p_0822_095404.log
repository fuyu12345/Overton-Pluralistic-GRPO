  [C9] Employers must ensure that all forms of compensation, including non-monetary ones, comply with labor laws and regulations
  [C10] In the perspective of **Global Workforce Diversity**, the effectiveness of smiling as a reward may vary across cultures
  [C11] In some cultures, direct praise and emotional expression are highly valued, while in others, more formal or monetary rewards are preferred
  [C12] In the perspective of **Long-Term Organizational Growth**, a smile-based compensation model can build a strong, emotionally intelligent workforce that is more adaptable and resilient
  [C13] This can contribute to long-term success by fostering innovation, teamwork, and customer satisfaction
  [C14] In the perspective of **Employee Autonomy**, paying with smiles can empower employees by recognizing their contributions in a way that aligns with their personal values and work ethic

  [C12] This reflection can lead to personal growth and improved parent-child relationships
  [C13] In the perspective of **societal expectations**, there is often pressure on parents to be strict and authoritative, which can lead to the use of yelling as a perceived necessary tool
  [C14] However, this expectation may not always align with the child's developmental needs
  [C15] In the perspective of **ethical parenting**, the use of yelling raises ethical concerns about the treatment of children and the responsibility of parents to nurture rather than harm
