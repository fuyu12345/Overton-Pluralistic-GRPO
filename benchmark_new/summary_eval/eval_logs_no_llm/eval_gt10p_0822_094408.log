Cand(8):

In the perspective of historical context, the idea of helping the poor at Auschwitz during a nuclear winter is a paradoxical and impossible scenario, as Auschwitz was a Nazi concentration camp where millions were systematically murdered, not a site for humanitarian aid
  [C2] In the perspective of ethical philosophy, the moral imperative to assist the poor is universal, yet the setting of Auschwitz during a nuclear winter introduces a dystopian context where such aid would be rendered meaningless by the scale of human suffering and environmental catastrophe
