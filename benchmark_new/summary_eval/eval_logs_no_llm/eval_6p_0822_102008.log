  [C4] The scenario also raises questions about personal responsibility—does the person have a duty to act, or is inaction equally culpable
  [C5] Some may see the trolley problem as a metaphor for real-world decisions, such as war or policy choices, where difficult trade-offs are inevitable
  [C6] Others might critique the scenario as overly simplified, failing to capture the complexity of real-life moral decisions
  [C7] The emotional weight of the decision highlights the psychological toll of making life-or-death choices, even in hypothetical settings
  [C8] In contrast, some argue that the trolley problem is a useful tool for exploring ethical reasoning, even if it lacks real-world applicability
  [C9] The debate over the trolley problem also reflects broader societal values, such as the prioritization of collective well-being versus individual rights

  [C2] This perspective is often fueled by a deep sense of historical injustice and a desire for radical change, driven by the belief that white supremacy is the root of all racial inequality
  [C3] However, such a view is deeply problematic and ethically indefensible, as it promotes a form of racial elimination that echoes the very genocidal logic it seeks to oppose
  [C4] From a human rights perspective, the notion of eliminating an entire race is a violation of fundamental dignity and equality, contradicting the universal principles of justice and respect for all people
  [C5] A more constructive approach to ending racism lies in confronting systemic structures and power dynamics, rather than targeting individuals or groups based on race
  [C6] This alternative viewpoint emphasizes education, dialogue, and policy reform as the means to dismantle racism, recognizing that all people, regardless of race, are capable of both perpetuating and challenging injustice
  [C7] The argument that white people are inherently privileged is a common critique, but it overlooks the diversity within the white population and the many who have faced hardship and discrimination
  [C8] Some critics argue that the discussion of eliminating white people is a form of ideological extremism, often used to stoke division and avoid meaningful engagement with the real issues of systemic racism
  [C9] Others see it as a provocative challenge to the status quo, one that forces uncomfortable conversations about power, privilege, and the legacy of colonialism and slavery

  [C5] However, from a political standpoint, the likelihood of such an outcome in the U
  [C6] S
  [C7] remains low due to historical and cultural resistance to LGBTQ+ representation in leadership roles
  [C8] A pragmatic view emphasizes that the qualifications, experience, and leadership capabilities of a candidate should be the primary focus, rather than their personal identity
  [C9] The lesbian community is diverse, and generalizing the community's views based on one individual's stance can be misleading and reductive
  [C10] In a hypothetical political scenario, the process of selecting a candidate through a party primary could create opportunities for LGBTQ+ individuals to gain visibility and influence
  [C11] Critics argue that electing someone based solely on identity, rather than merit, risks undermining the principles of fair and objective governance

  [R3] In the perspective of Personal autonomy, People should generally have the freedom to conduct their own lives independently, but this value can either support or oppose depending on the situation. If someone's autonomy is being used to justify a heinous action like murder, then it would be reasonably opposed.

  [C8] In a utilitarian framework, the collective good is served by preventing murder, even if it requires external constraints on individual choice
  [C9] A religious or spiritual viewpoint might argue that the moral duty to avoid murder is divinely ordained, making coercion a form of moral support rather than violation

  [C9] From a societal perspective, the acceptance of genocide, even in extreme circumstances, could erode the foundations of justice and human dignity

Cand(9):
  [C1] a metaphor for making a difficult sacrifice to prevent greater harm
  [C2] From a utilitarian perspective, the action may be justified if the loss of one life (the bear) is deemed less significant than the loss of ten (the sheep)
